# Emotion-based music recommendation system

The Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System is an intelligent application that recommends songs based on the user's emotions. It leverages facial recognition and machine learning techniques to detect emotions and suggests music accordingly.

 Features:

🎭 Emotion Detection: Uses facial recognition to identify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.
🎶 Music Recommendation: Maps detected emotions to an appropriate playlist.
🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI for capturing user emotions and displaying song recommendations.
🔊 Spotify Integration : Play recommended songs directly.

Technologies Used:

Python (Flask for backend, OpenCV for face detection)
TensorFlow/Keras (Emotion recognition model)
Pandas & NumPy (Data handling)
OpenCV (For face detection & processing)
Scikit-Learn (Machine learning algorithms)
Streamlit / Tkinter (For GUI, if applicable)
CSV Dataset (Emotion-labeled music dataset)
